GunSwitch Game Dev Repository

All TODO things should be placed into the ToDoList.docx file

The Discord link is https://discord.gg/FTfY9Nw
Make sure to read the links posted in the "just_unity_things" room
before saving any files from within Unity. If you don't change preferences,
your commits won't play nice. Place any Coding questions in "coding".
You can place resources you put in the unity _sprites folder into the "resourcedump"
on discord.
You can place design ideas in the "gamedesignroom" so we know what's up for next session.
This helps us decide how the game should work, whether it is how tanks move, climb or shoot,
or how some bullets, levels, or terrain should function.
